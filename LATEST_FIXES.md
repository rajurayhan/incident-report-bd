## Issues Addressed

- Verified API routes and controller methods exist and are properly configured

**Files Modified:**
- `resources/js/components/MyActivity.vue`
  - Added detailed error logging
  - Added fallback for empty data (`|| []`)

### 2. Login Form Spacing ✅

**Problem:** No space between email and password fields on the sign-in form.

**Solution:**
- Changed from `space-y-px` (1px gap) to `space-y-4` (1rem/16px gap)
- Changed from `rounded-none` to `rounded-md` for individual field styling
- Removed the stacked appearance for cleaner, more modern look

**Files Modified:**
- `resources/js/components/Login.vue`
  - Line 17: Changed `class="rounded-md shadow-sm -space-y-px"` to `class="space-y-4"`
  - Line 27: Changed input classes to use `rounded-md` instead of `rounded-t-md`
  - Line 40: Changed input classes to use `rounded-md` instead of `rounded-b-md`

**Visual Changes:**
- Email and password fields now have proper spacing (16px gap)
- Each field is independently rounded
- More modern, spacious appearance

### 3. Multi-Language Support (English & Bangla) ✅

**Problem:** Application only supported English language.

**Solution:**
Implemented complete internationalization (i18n) system using Vue I18n v9.

#### New Files Created:

1. **Translation Files:**
   - `resources/js/locales/en.js` - English translations
   - `resources/js/locales/bn.js` - Bangla (বাংলা) translations

2. **I18n Configuration:**
   - `resources/js/i18n.js` - Vue I18n setup with localStorage persistence

3. **Language Switcher Component:**
   - `resources/js/components/LanguageSwitcher.vue` - Dropdown component for switching languages

#### Translation Coverage:

**Navigation (nav):**
- Home, Report Incident, Map, Analytics
- Login, Register, Profile, My Reports, My Activity, Logout

**Authentication (auth):**
- Sign in/up forms
- Email, Username, Password fields
- Forgot/Reset password
- Button states (loading)

**Incidents (incident):**
- Title, Description, Category, Status, Priority
- Comments section (add, reply, delete)
- Verification actions
- Load more functionality

**Profile (profile):**
- Profile update form
- Change password
- User statistics

**Activity (activity):**
- My Activity page
- Comments and verifications tabs
- Empty states

**Common Terms (common):**
- Cancel, Save, Edit, Delete, Close
- Back, Next, Submit
- Search, Filter, All

#### Files Modified:

1. **`resources/js/app.js`**
   - Imported i18n module
   - Added `app.use(i18n)` to Vue app

2. **`resources/js/components/Navigation.vue`**
   - Imported `LanguageSwitcher` component
   - Changed hardcoded labels to use `$t('nav.{key}')`
   - Added language switcher to desktop navigation bar
   - Positioned between navigation links and user menu

3. **`resources/js/components/Login.vue`**
   - All text labels converted to use `$t()` function
   - Form fields use translated placeholders
   - Button states use translations

#### Package Installed:
```bash
npm install vue-i18n@9 --save
```

#### How to Use:

**For Users:**
1. Look for the language switcher in the navigation bar (globe icon)
2. Click to see available languages (English, বাংলা)
3. Select preferred language
4. Selection is saved to localStorage and persists across sessions

**For Developers:**
To add translations to a component:
```vue
<template>
  <div>{{ $t('nav.home') }}</div>
</template>
```

To add new translations:
1. Add keys to `resources/js/locales/en.js`
2. Add corresponding Bangla translations to `resources/js/locales/bn.js`

#### Language Files Structure:
```javascript
{
  nav: { ... },        // Navigation items
  auth: { ... },       // Authentication forms
  incident: { ... },   // Incident related
  profile: { ... },    // Profile page
  activity: { ... },   // My Activity page
  common: { ... }      // Common terms
}
```
