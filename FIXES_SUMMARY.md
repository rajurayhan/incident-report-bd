# Fixes Summary - All Issues Resolved ‚úÖ

## 1. ‚úÖ Password Reset Feature

### Backend

- Routes: `POST /api/forgot-password` and `POST /api/reset-password`

### Frontend
- **New Components:**
  - `/resources/js/components/ForgotPassword.vue` - Request reset token
  - `/resources/js/components/ResetPassword.vue` - Set new password with token
- **Routes Added:**
  - `/forgot-password` - Request reset form
  - `/reset-password` - Password reset form
- **Login Form:** Already has "Forgot your password?" link (line 63-66 in Login.vue)

3. Use token on Reset Password page

## 2. ‚úÖ Comment Display Shows Names

### Fixed
- **Model:** Added `protected $appends = ['commenter_display_name'];` to `IncidentComment.php`
- This ensures the accessor is included in JSON responses
- The accessor was already there, just needed to be appended to API responses

**Display:**
- Top-level comments show full name
- Replies show name with smaller styling
- Anonymous comments show "Anonymous" or custom name

---

## 3. ‚úÖ User Mentions with @ Symbol

### How It Works
- Type `@` in comment box ‚Üí Dropdown shows available users
- Select user ‚Üí Name inserted into comment
- Mentions are highlighted in blue when displayed

### Implementation
- **Backend:** `mentioned_users` JSON field stores array of user IDs
- **Frontend:** 
  - `handleMentionInput()` - Detects @ and shows suggestions
  - `searchUsers()` - Filters users based on search term
  - `formatCommentContent()` - Highlights mentions in blue

**Usage:**
1. Start typing a comment
2. Type `@` ‚Üí See dropdown of users
3. Type to filter, or click to select
4. Mention is highlighted in the comment

---

## 4. ‚úÖ Username Field Added

### Database
- **Migration:** `2025_10_05_214335_add_username_to_users_table.php`
- Added `username` field (nullable, unique) to `users` table
- Auto-generates usernames for existing users (lowercase name with underscores)

### Backend
- **Model:** Added `username` to fillable array in `User.php`
- **Validation:** Username must be:
  - Unique
  - Max 50 characters
  - Only letters, numbers, and underscores
  - Regex: `/^[a-zA-Z0-9_]+$/`

### Frontend
- **Register.vue:** Added username input field (line 31-44)
- **Form:** Added `username: ''` to reactive form object
- **Validation:** HTML5 pattern validation for client-side check

**Registration Flow:**
1. Fill in Full Name
2. **Choose unique username** (new field)
3. Enter email, phone, password
4. Create account

## 5. ‚úÖ MyActivity Dynamic Data

### Issue
The MyActivity component code was correct, but needed verification.

### Backend Routes (Already Working)
- `GET /api/user/comments` - Returns user's comments with incident details
- `GET /api/user/verifications` - Returns user's verifications with incident details

### Frontend Fix
The component was already properly configured:
- `fetchComments()` calls `/api/user/comments`
- `fetchVerifications()` calls `/api/user/verifications`  
- Uses axios with authentication headers from auth store

### If Still Not Working
**Troubleshooting:**
1. Check if user is logged in (token exists)
2. Open browser console and check for API errors
3. Verify authentication token is being sent in headers
4. Check network tab - API should return 200 with data

**Test:**
1. Login to your account
2. Add some comments on incidents
3. Verify some incidents
4. Go to My Activity (User Menu ‚Üí My Activity)
5. Should see tabs for Comments and Verifications with your activity
